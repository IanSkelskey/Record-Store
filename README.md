# Record Store

Project designed for SER322: Database Management at Arizona State University by group 18 for Summer Session B 2022.

## Description

Record Store is a database and application to aid record store employees. The system should allow 
employees to find what a customer is looking for. The database contains a list of records and their stock quantity
along with additional information about artists, songs, genres, etc.

    ("Alternative Rock", "Alternative Rock is a style of Rock music that is characterized as unconventional or outside the mainstream."),
    ("Folk", "Folk is a type of traditional and generally rural music that originally was passed down through families and other small social groups"),
    ("Indie", "Indie, or independent music, refers to music that is produced independently from commercial record labels or their subsidiaries"),
	("Hip-hop", "It consists of stylized rhythmic music (usually built around drum beats) that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted"),
    ("Alternative/Indie", "Alternative and indie, at their roots, stand more for vague ideas and beliefs than any kind of specific musical styles of sounds, and truly the only real difference is the location of the artist: alternative was the preferred nomenclature of American artists while indie came straight from the British Isles.");
