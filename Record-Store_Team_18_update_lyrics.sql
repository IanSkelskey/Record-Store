            From head to toe with endless feeling
            Try to explain just what I see
            You say to me I must be dreaming
            You called my name the way
            I wished you would in my imagination
            Now every single thing around me
            Filling me with this sensation

            In my searching around
            I\'ve seen so many faces
            Now I\'ve found the one I needed
            And the sun is rising

            I woke up today
            Like I wanted
            Since you walked my way
            I found my strength to feel it
            I woke up today
            Heaven knows it
            Found a girl who makes me see

            Ahh

            Spoke up today about the things in my life
            I didn\'t think I needed
            They flew outside my window pane
            Now pain is not to be kept a secret
            (No more, baby, yeah)
            These walls are built for no exceptions
            To the things I\'ve treasured dearly
            And now the dust has cleared away
            But baby, I see you don\'t need me

            In this crazy old world
            I\'ve been so many places
            See now, I\'m gonna need some shelter
            When the sun is sinking

            I woke up today
            Like I wanted
            Since you walked my way
            I found my strength to feel it
            I woke up today
            Heaven knows it
            Found a girl who makes me see

            I woke up today
            Like I wanted
            Since you walked my way
            I found my, found my strength to feel it
            I woke up today
            Like I wanted
            Since you walked my way
            I found my, found my strength to feel it
            I woke up today
            Like I wanted
            Since you walked my way
            I found my, found my strength to feel it

            I woke up today
            Like I wanted to
            Since you walked my way
            Woke up today just like I wanted to
            Found my strength to feel it, oh'

             (Stone age family)
             From the town of Bedrock
             They\'re a page right out of history
             Let\'s ride with the family down the street
             Through the courtesy of Fred\'s two feet
             When you\'re with the Flintstones
             Have a yabba-dabba-doo old time
             Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
             They\'re a modern stone age family
             From the town of Bedrock
             They\'re a page right out of history
             Let\'s ride with the family down the street
             Through the courtesy of Fred\'s two feet
             When you\'re with the Flintstones
             Have a yabba-yabba-doo time
             Have a yabba-doo time
             We\'re gonna have a gay old time
             Whoa, whoa
             Whoa, whoa
             Whoa, whoa
             Whoa, whoa
             Now it\'s time to meet the Flintstones
             Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
             They\'re a modern stone age family
             From the town of Bedrock
             They\'re a page right out of history
             Someday, maybe Fred will win the fight
             And that cat will stay out for the night
             When you\'re with the Flintstones
             Have a yabba-yabba-doo time
             We\'ll have a gay old time'
        WHEN
            10
        THEN
            'In the real early morning
             With the sun slowly rising
             I was walking out slowly
             Wandering free
             When out in the distance
             Over the valley
             I saw an old friend
             Waiting for me
             Waiting for me
             She was a young girl
             She was an old soul
             As fair as the ocean
             Timeless and free
             She was my mother
             She was my daughter
             She was my lover
             She was everything
             An old friend could be
             I said, "It\'s been such a long time
             Since we have spoken
             There\'s so much to say to you
             I want you to know
             I wish you could tell me
             All that you\'ve seen here
             But we haven\'t got long now
             For soon, you\'ll be fading
             And soon, I must go"
             I know the way home
             She said "You are a soldier
             You are a father
             You are a wise man
             You are a friend
             You were my first love
             I won\'t forget you
             I\'m walking beside you
             I was here when you started
             I\'ll be here till the end"
             And now it\'s the evening
             There\'s a moon slowly rising (ooh, ooh)
             There isn\'t much more that
             I wanted to know, wanted to know
             And I am alone now
             She isn\'t beside me no more
             But I feel no sorrow
             I\'d come tomorrow
             I\'ll be on my way home
             I\'ll be on my way home'
        WHEN
            11
        THEN
            'Sticks and stones, I won\'t hide from you no more
             And in time I find what I\'ve been searching for
             I heard your voice calling out to me
             I\'m on my way to where I can be free
             And if she won\'t wait for me, do it right, don\'t look back, keep my heart on the future
             On the soles of my shoes are all the places I\'ve been, that I\'ve known since I knew her
             \'Cause it\'s you, don\'t you know that you\'re making me guess that you\'re the one for me
             And that it\'s you that I guess that I wanted to know all along
             And that it\'s you that I want, that it makes me complete, \'cause you\'re the one for me
             It\'s thanks to you that I guess that I want you to know I belong
             Every time I lose my feeling true
             I still work to lead me back to you
             In my dreams, I\'m calling out your name
             You\'re my beacon, burning the flame ya
             Now let\'s fly on my wings, through the night, don\'t look back, now I don\'t want to lose her
             In the sky are the sounds of the night, now I know that I couldn\'t refuse her
             \'Cause it\'s you, don\'t you know that you\'re making me guess that you\'re the one for me
             And that it\'s you that I guess that I wanted to know all along
             And that it\'s you that I want, that it makes me complete, \'cause you\'re the one for me
             It\'s thanks to you that I guess that I want you to know I belong
             Up above the universe aglow
             And the world is turning down below
             Through the day and through the coldest night
             Light my way, give me strength to burn bright
             Now take me up to the sky, off my mind, far away from the heavens below me
             Make it slow, keep my soul, give me strength in my bones, now you can\'t really save me
             \'Cause it\'s you, don\'t you know that you\'re making me guess that you\'re the one for me
             And that it\'s you that I guess that I wanted to know all along
             And that it\'s you that I want, that it makes me complete, \'cause you\'re the one for me
             It\'s thanks to you that I guess that I want you to know I belong'

        They slither wildley as they slip away across the universe
        Pools of sorrow waves of joy
        Drifting through my open mind
        Possessing and caressing me
        Nothing\'s gonna change my world
        Nothing\'s gonna change my world
        Nothing\'s gonna change my world
        Nothing\'s gonna change my world

        Which dance before me like a million eyes
        They call me on and on across the universe

        They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
        Nothing\'s gonna change my world

        Nothing\'s gonna change my world
        Nothing\'s gonna change my world

        Are ringing through my opened ears
        Inciting and inviting me
        Limitless undying love
        Which shines around me like a million suns
        It calls me on and on across the universe
